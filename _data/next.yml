  title: "Individual and social processes in image description generation"
  abstract: "Most language use takes place in situated environments where visual perception goes hand in hand with language processing. I will discuss some recent projects by my research group related to modelling language generation in visually grounded contexts using state-of-the-art AI techniques. I will first focus on individual cognitive processes and present a model of image description generation that exploits information from human gaze patterns recorded during language production. In the second part of the talk, I will move on to two-person dialogue setups. I will discuss our recent work on generating referring descriptions that are grounded in the conversational and visual context. I argue that computational models of language generation can help us to better understand the cognitive processes underpinning these abilities in humans, as well as contribute to more robust language technology tools and to user adaptation in dialogue systems."

  title: "The Moral Machine Experiment"
  abstract: "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence have come concerns about how machines will make moral decisions, and the major challenge of quantifying societal expectations about the ethical principles that should guide machine behaviour. To address this challenge, we deployed the Moral Machine, an online experimental platform designed to explore the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233 countries and territories. I will describe the results of this experiment, paying special attention to cross-cultural variations in ethical preferences. I will discuss the role that these data can play to inform public policies about the programming of autonomous vehicles."
