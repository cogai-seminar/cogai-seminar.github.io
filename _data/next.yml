  title: " Towards a recipe for physical reasoning in humans and machines"
  abstract: "The world is structured in countless ways. When cognitive and machine models respect these structures, by factorizing their modules and parameters, they can achieve remarkable accuracy and generalization. In this talk, I will discuss our work investigating the factorizations of objects, relations, and physics in both humans and machines. Focusing on problems in physical reasoning including construction and tool use, I will show how to harness object and relational structure in the form of graph networks and probabilistic programs to improve machine generalization and explain how people can rapidly acquire new tool-using strategies, like the notion of a catapult, from just a handful of experiences. By taking better advantage of problem structure, and combining it with general-purpose methods for statistical learning, we can develop more robust and data-efficient machine agents, and better explain how humans learn so much from so little."
