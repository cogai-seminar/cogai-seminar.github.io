  title: "Neural mechanisms of encoding, learning and producing complex sequences and their syntax"
  abstract: "The work of Xavier Hinaut is at the frontier of various domains (neurosciences, machine learning, robotics and linguistics): from the modeling of the neuronal encoding of primate motor sequences categories to the decoding of sensorimotor neuronal activity in songbirds (domestic canaries). An important part is dedicated to the modeling of the processing of human sentences with recurrent neural networks, which is the starting point of applications to Human-Robot Interaction with natural language. He is interested in the neural mechanisms of encoding, learning and producing complex sequences and their syntax. One of the translational goals is to find a common generic neural substrate model, based on random recurrent neural networks. Such generic substrate can learn the bases of syntax in several languages and model the learning of motor and vocal sequences in various species. Such model is also applied to the learning of bird singing by approaching biological and developmental constraints. Although we cannot talk about the language of birds, some birds like domestic canaries produce songs with a complex syntax that is difficult to characterize only in terms of Markovian processes (i.e. with transitions based on very short-term memory). Therefore, he also studies the working memory capabilities and limitations of recurrent random neural networks. In particular, he looks how such networks can learn information gating mechanisms."
