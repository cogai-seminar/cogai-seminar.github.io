  title: "Neural mechanisms of encoding, learning and producing complex sequences and their syntax"
  abstract: "The work of Xavier Hinaut is at the frontier of various domains (neurosciences, machine learning, robotics and linguistics): from the modeling of the neuronal encoding of primate motor sequences categories to the decoding of sensorimotor neuronal activity in songbirds (domestic canaries). An important part is dedicated to the modeling of the processing of human sentences with recurrent neural networks, which is the starting point of applications to Human-Robot Interaction with natural language. He is interested in the neural mechanisms of encoding, learning and producing complex sequences and their syntax. One of the translational goals is to find a common generic neural substrate model, based on random recurrent neural networks. Such generic substrate can learn the bases of syntax in several languages and model the learning of motor and vocal sequences in various species. Such model is also applied to the learning of bird singing by approaching biological and developmental constraints. Although we cannot talk about the language of birds, some birds like domestic canaries produce songs with a complex syntax that is difficult to characterize only in terms of Markovian processes (i.e. with transitions based on very short-term memory). Therefore, he also studies the working memory capabilities and limitations of recurrent random neural networks. In particular, he looks how such networks can learn information gating mechanisms."

  title: "Mechanics of cognitive processes."
  abstract: " Cognitive abilities arise from the interactions of neurons organized in structured networks. Understanding the emergence of cognitive abilities requires to bridge two gaps: the one between behavioral variables and network’s dynamics, and the one between dynamics and structure of networks. Theoretical investigations have been able to propose such mappings for elementary cognitive processes but it has remained difficult to come up with network structures able to implement more elaborated cognitive processes. To overcome this difficulty it has been proposed to take advantage of machine learning algorithms to build network’s structure that implement behaviors of interest. However these networks remain high-dimensional non-linear systems that are often referred to as ‘black-boxes’. I will start by presenting the approach I have developed with Srdjan Ostojic that allows to fully reverse-engineer trained networks and bridge the gaps between behavior, network’s dynamics and network’s structure. I will then illustrate this approach by focusing on a context-dependent decision making task. Finally I will briefly discuss preliminary attempts in applying this approach to characterize neural network mechanisms underlying the production of structured sequences."
